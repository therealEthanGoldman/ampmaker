For the Future Imperfect Larp! 

This program will use program.cs to open formula.cs, use formula.cs functions to arrange the modified formula, then 'prints' the label.

To use this program you have to use a console window, ui and engineer features are to be added later, as is the means to save formulas.

Have fun.
